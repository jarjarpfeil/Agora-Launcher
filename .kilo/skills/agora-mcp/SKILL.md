# Agora MCP Server Guide

## Overview

The Agora launcher runs a local MCP server on `127.0.0.1:39741` that exposes 6 tools for managing Minecraft mod instances and diagnosing crashes. The server is built into the desktop app and runs when the user has "AI / MCP Server" enabled in Settings.

The server speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP with SSE (Server-Sent Events) for response delivery. Tools are called via the `tools/call` method with `name` and `arguments` in the params. All tool responses are wrapped in a JSON object with `content` (array of `{type: "text", text: "..."}`) and `isError` fields.

## The 6 Tools

### 1. `list_instances`

- **Params:** None
- **Returns:** `{"instances": [{"instance_id", "name", "minecraft_version", "loader", "loader_version"}, ...]}`
- **Use when:** You need to know what instances exist before any instance-specific operation. Always call this first when a user mentions an instance by name so you can match it to an `instance_id`.

### 2. `list_instance_mods`

- **Params:** `instance_id` (string) — the instance ID to list mods for.
- **Returns:** `{"mods": [{"filename", "version", "source", "mod_jar_id", "depends_on", "optional_deps", "java_packages"}, ...]}`
- **Use when:** You need to see what mods are installed, check dependency chains, or find which mod a Java package belongs to. Call after `list_instances` to inspect a specific instance's mod list.

### 3. `disable_mod`

- **Params:** `instance_id` (string), `filename` (string) — the mod filename to disable.
- **Returns:** On success: `{"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Mod <filename> disabled in instance <id>. Restart the game to apply."}], "isError": false}`. On failure: `{"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "<error message>"}], "isError": true}`.
- **Destructive — requires user approval.** The user must grant `disable_mod` permission for each instance in Agora Settings → MCP → Approvals. If not granted, returns `ERR_MCP_DENIED` with an error message directing the user to grant permission.
- **Use when:** You've identified a suspect mod and want to disable it for testing. The user must restart the game for the change to take effect.

### 4. `search_crash_signatures`

- **Params:** `crash_text` (string) — the full crash log text.
- **Returns:** `{"matches": [{"id", "name", "fix_hint"}, ...]}` — curated crash signature patterns that match the crash text, with their fix hints.
- **Use when:** A user shares a crash log — search for known curated patterns first before deeper analysis. This is the fastest path to a solution when a curated signature exists.

### 5. `suggest_mod_incompatibility`

- **Params:** `instance_id` (string), `crash_text` (string) — the crash log text to analyze.
- **Returns:** `{"suspects": [{"mod_id", "filename", "total_score", "is_dependent_of", "breakdown"}, ...]}` — ranked suspect mods from a dynamic weighted scoring algorithm.
  - `total_score`: higher means more likely to be the cause.
  - `is_dependent_of`: set to another mod's filename if this mod indirectly depends on a direct suspect (reduced score).
  - `breakdown`: per-signal score contribution. Signal letters:
    - **A** — stack-frame attribution (the mod's `java_packages` appear in the crash stack trace).
    - **B** — fingerprint recurrence (this mod has been attributed in past crashes).
    - **C** — co-crash signal (this mod co-occurs in crashes with other suspects).
    - **D** — dampened by survival ubiquity (penalty for mods installed everywhere).
    - **E** — confirmed prior (the mod was previously confirmed as a crash cause).
    - **G** — curated conflict (a curated conflict entry flags these two mods).
    - **F** — recency factor (recent attributions weigh more).
- **Use when:** A crash log doesn't match a curated signature, or you need deeper analysis of which mod is causing the crash. The scoring algorithm gets smarter over time — confirmed attributions create priors that speed up future diagnosis.

### 6. `get_system_context`

- **Params:** None
- **Returns:** A markdown summary with sections for Instances, Installed Mods, and Recent Crashes.
- **Use when:** You need an overview of the user's system state before diagnosing an issue, or when the user asks "what do you know about my setup?".

## Crash Diagnosis Workflow

Follow this decision tree when a user reports a crash:

1. **Get context.** If you don't know the user's setup, call `get_system_context` or `list_instances` to understand what instances and mods they have.

2. **Quick check.** If the user shares a crash log, call `search_crash_signatures` first. This is the fastest path — if a curated signature matches, you can provide the fix hint immediately.

3. **Deep analysis.** If no curated match: call `suggest_mod_incompatibility` with the `instance_id` and crash text. This runs the weighted scoring algorithm across all installed mods.

4. **Review suspects.** Examine the ranked suspects — the top suspect has the highest `total_score`. Check the `breakdown` to understand why:
   - `"A: 2.0"` means the mod's Java packages appear in the crash stack trace (strongest signal).
   - `"E: 1.5"` means this mod was previously confirmed as a crash cause.
   - `"B: 1.0"` means the crash fingerprint has appeared with this mod before.
   - Look at the total score to gauge confidence.

5. **Confirm and disable.** If the top suspect looks correct:
   - Call `list_instance_mods` to confirm the mod is installed and verify its details.
   - Call `disable_mod` to disable it (requires user approval). Explain to the user that they need to restart the game for the change to take effect.

6. **Follow up.** If the crash persists after disabling the suspect:
   - Check `is_dependent_of` in the suspect list for mods that depend on the disabled one — they may be the indirect cause.
   - Consider other suspects in the ranked list.

7. **No suspects above zero.** If no suspects score above zero, the crash is likely not mod-related (game engine issue, world corruption, shaders, etc.). Advise the user accordingly.

## Important Notes

- **`disable_mod` is the only destructive tool.** It requires explicit per-instance approval in Agora Settings → MCP → Approvals. If you receive `ERR_MCP_DENIED`, tell the user to grant permission for that instance.

- **The scoring algorithm learns.** When you disable a mod and the crash stops, that attribution is recorded as a prior (signal E). This speeds up future diagnosis for similar crashes.

- **`java_packages` may be empty for older mods.** `suggest_mod_incompatibility` uses `java_packages` extracted from `.jar` files at install time to match stack frames to mods (signal A). Mods installed before this feature existed may have empty `java_packages` and won't match on signal A.

- **Indirect suspects.** Mods with `is_dependent_of` set are mods that depend on a direct suspect. They have reduced scores and are worth testing if the direct suspect is ruled out — disabling the direct mod may have disabled a dependency that another mod relied on.

- **Rate limiting.** The server enforces a rate limit of 100 requests per 60 seconds per session. If you hit `ERR_MCP_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`, slow down your tool calls.

- **Connection.** The server only accepts connections from `127.0.0.1` (loopback). No authentication is required — the localhost binding is the security boundary.
